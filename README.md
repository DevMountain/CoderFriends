CoderFriends
============

## Objective

Use a Node backend with Passport and Express to show a user's coder friends.

## Resources

* [passport-github2] (https://github.com/cfsghost/passport-github)
* [Github API Docs] (https://developer.github.com/v3/)
* [axios] (https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

## Step 1: Create Skeleton of Angular App

To mix it up, let's create the file structure for the Angular app first.

* Create a `/public` folder
* Create the following files:
  * app.js
  * services/github-service.js
  * index.html
  * templates/home.html
  * templates/friend.html

Let's create routes for our app:

#### /

The base route should display a "Login with Github" button that will redirect users to `/auth/github`. You may accomplish this by either 1) making a login.html templateUrl for this route, or 2) using an inline template in the route configuration (rather than a templateUrl).

#### /home

The home route will display the current user's GitHub friends via the home.html template

#### /friend/:github_username

This route will display a friend's information as well as what they're currently working on.

Create the `index.js` file and set it up to serve your static files.

## Step 2: Create the auth endpoints

* Install and require your dependencies
  * express
  * express-session
  * passport
  * passport-github2
* [Create a Github app](https://github.com/settings/applications) and then set up the Github Strategy in your `index.js` with your associated `clientID` and `clientSecret`. Use a callbackURL that will redirect the user to `/auth/github/callback`
* Make sure you use the session, passport.initialize and passport.session middelware
* Set up your auth endpoints:

#### /auth/github

Use passport.authenticate with Github

#### /auth/github/callback

Use passport.authenticate and upon successful auth, send the user to `/#/home`

## Step 3: Github following Endpoint

Let's link the Angular Github service to our `index.js`

#### GET `/api/github/following`

In `index.js`, create a `/api/github/following` endpoint and have it return the users that the currently logged in user follows. To do this, you will need to make an API call directly from your `index.js` file. Do do this we will are going to use a package called [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) which makes it easy to send requests from our server.

* With the username of the user currently logged in, use `axios` to send a request to  
  `https://api.github.com/users/`username`/followers`

#### Require Auth With Middleware
* Let's make sure that whichever client that requests this endpoint is currently logged in. The best way to do this would be to write a middleware function that runs before the "get followers" logic so that you're sure that the current requesting user is logged in. Your middleware function could look like this:

```
var requireAuth = function(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return res.status(403).end();
  }
  return next();
}
```

* Add this new middleware function to your route
```
app.get('/api/github/following', requireAuth, __your_other_fn_here__)
```

## Step 4: homeCtrl + Github Service

Now let's connect your Angular app to this setup.

* In GithubService, create a `getFollowing` method that returns the results from the API call we created in Step 3.
* Let's resolve the promise from `getFollowing` into a `friends` variable in the `/home` route before it loads.
* In your homeCtrl (create this file, or do an inline controller in the home route in `app.js`), let's throw friends into the scope and render them in the view (home.html).

## Step 5: NG un-authed auto-redirect

Earlier we created a middleware function that responsed with a 403 if a user was not authorized. Let's make our angular app watch for a 403 status on every response and, when a response does have a 403 status, redirect our browser to our login page.

We can do that by injecting a service that acts as an interceptor in Angular's $httpProvider. Add this chunk of code to your `app.js` file:

```
app.config(function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';
    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
});

// register the interceptor as a service
app.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q) {
    return {
        // optional method
        'responseError': function(rejection) {
            if (rejection.status == 403) {
                document.location = '/';
                return;
            }
            return $q.reject(rejection);
        }
    };
});
```

## Step 5: Friend route

Make it so that when the user clicks on one of the selected friends, it loads in that user's latest activity.

#### GET /api/github/:username/activity

Create this endpoint in your `index.js` that grabs data for the given username.
* Using `axios` send a request to:  
  `https://api.github.com/users/`username`/events`
* Create a method in your Github service called `getFriendActivity` and make sure it's passed a username
* Have `eventData` be a resolved variable in the app's routing, then render each of the events in the `/friend/:github_username` route in `friend.html`.
